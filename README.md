# click-the-cute-cat
** There is a cute cat waiting inside to let you click on her face, on her tongue.
** Don't be afraid she is very cute and friendly.

## Built
* Used some basic HTML , CSS to make this cat-clicker.
* Used just a single function in the javascript to run this project.

## I learned how simple javascript function can be used to run the whole project without adding any heap of code to the project.
